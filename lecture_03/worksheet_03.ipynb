Then you process and explore data, extract features from the data, and then actually creating the model. Processing data involves asking questions about the data and its flaws along with asking what data you should actually use. Exploring the data involves analyzing it. Feature extraction involves seeing if the data is the best to use for this models creation. The model is created based on some algorithm."
